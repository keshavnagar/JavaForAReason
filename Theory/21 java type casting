Java type casting is the process of converting a value from one data type to another. 

2 types : 

1. Widening Type Casting (Implicit Casting/automatically):

Definition: Automatically converting a smaller data type to a larger data type.

Why it's safe: There's no risk of data loss because the target type has a larger range or capacity.

eg : in p file that name is Implicit.java

2.  Narrowing Type Casting (Explicit Casting/manually):

Definition: Manually converting a larger data type to a smaller data type.

Why it's risky: There may be a loss of data or precision, so it must be explicitly done by the programmer.

targetType variableName = (targetType) value;

eg : p file Explicit.java
