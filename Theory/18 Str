Str : 

String data type is used to store a sequence of characters (text). String values must be surrounded by double quotes:

eg : in Str.java 

The String type is so much used and integrated in Java, that some call it "the special ninth type".

A String in Java is actually a non-primitive data type, because it refers to an object. The String object has methods that are used to perform certain operations on strings.
