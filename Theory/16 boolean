1. Boolean Types 

Very often in programming, you will need a data type that can only have one of two values, like:

YES / NO
ON / OFF
TRUE / FALSE

1.1. For this, Java has a boolean data type, which can only take the values true or false:

eg : boolean isPlacement = true;
boolean isNotPlacement = false;
System.out.println(isPlacement);     // Outputs true
System.out.println(isNotPlacement);   // Outputs false

Boolean values are mostly used for conditional testing.
