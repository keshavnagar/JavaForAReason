Java Strings

Strings are used for storing text.

A String variable contains a collection of characters surrounded by double quotes:

Example

Create a variable of type String and assign it a value:

String greeting = "Hello";

String Length

A String in Java is actually an object, which contain methods that can perform certain operations on strings. For example, the length of a string can be found with the length() method:

eg : in StrLen.java file 

More String Methods

There are many string methods available, for example toUpperCase() and toLowerCase():

Example
String txt = "Hello World";
System.out.println(txt.toUpperCase());   // Outputs "HELLO WORLD"
System.out.println(txt.toLowerCase());   // Outputs "hello world"

Finding a Character in a String
The indexOf() method returns the index (the position) of the first occurrence of a specified text in a string (including whitespace):

String txt = "Please locate where 'locate' occurs!";
System.out.println(txt.indexOf("locate")); // Outputs 7

String Concatenation
The + operator can be used between strings to combine them. This is called concatenation:

ExampleGet your own Java Server
String firstName = "John";
String lastName = "Doe";
System.out.println(firstName + " " + lastName);

You can also use the concat() method to concatenate two strings:

Example
String firstName = "John ";
String lastName = "Doe";
System.out.println(firstName.concat(lastName)); (apply on Concat.java in Practical)
