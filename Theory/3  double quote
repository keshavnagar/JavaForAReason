1. Double Quotes : 

text must be wrapped inside double quotes "".

eg : System.out.println("Hello")

2. The Print() Method
There is also a print() method, which is similar to println().

The only difference is that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output:

eg : System.out.print("Hello World! ");
System.out.print("I will print on the same line.");
