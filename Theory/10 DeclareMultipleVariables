Declare Many Variables
To declare more than one variable of the same type, you can use a comma-separated list:

ExampleGet your own Java Server
Instead of writing:

int x = 5;
int y = 6;
int z = 50;
System.out.println(x + y + z);
You can simply write:

int x = 5, y = 6, z = 50;
System.out.println(x + y + z);

so wee apply this in our p file 6.
