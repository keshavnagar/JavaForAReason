operator : Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:

Example
int x = 100 + 50;

Although the + operator is often used to add together two values, like in the example above, it can also be used to add together a variable and a value, or a variable and another variable:

Example
int sum1 = 100 + 50;        // 150 (100 + 50)
int sum2 = sum1 + 250;      // 400 (150 + 250)
int sum3 = sum2 + sum2;     // 800 (400 + 400)

Java divides the operators into the following groups:

Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Logical operators
Bitwise operators

+	Addition	        Adds together two values	                    x + y	
-	Subtraction	        Subtracts one value from another	            x - y	
*	Multiplication	    Multiplies two values	                        x * y	
/	Division	        Divides one value by another	                x / y	
%	Modulus	            Returns the division remainder	                x % y	
++	Increment	        Increases the value of a variable by 1	        ++x	
--	Decrement	        Decreases the value of a variable by 1	        --x

Java Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

In the example below, we use the assignment operator (=) to assign the value 10 to a variable called x:

Example
int x = 10;

The addition assignment operator (+=) adds a value to a variable:

Example
int x = 10;
x += 5;

A list of all assignment operators:

Operator	                        Example	        Same As	Try it
=	                                x = 5	        x = 5	
+=	                                x += 3	        x = x + 3	
-=	                                x -= 3	        x = x - 3	
*=	                                x *= 3	        x = x * 3	
/=	                                x /= 3	        x = x / 3	
%=	                                x %= 3	        x = x % 3	
&=	                                x &= 3	        x = x & 3	
|=	                                x |= 3	        x = x | 3	
^=	                                x ^= 3	        x = x ^ 3	
>>=	                                x >>= 3	        x = x >> 3	
<<=	                                x <<= 3	        x = x << 3


Java Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values.  it helps us to find answers and make decisions.

The return value of a comparison is either true or false. These values are known as Boolean values

In the following example, we use the greater than operator (>) to find out if 5 is greater than 3:

Example
int x = 5;
int y = 3;
System.out.println(x > y); // returns true, because 5 is higher than 3

Operator	        Name	                    Example	Try it
==	                Equal to	                x == y	
!=	                Not equal	                x != y	
>	                Greater than	            x > y	
<	                Less than	                x < y	
>=	                Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
<=	                Less than or equal to	    x <= y

Java Logical Operators

You can also test for true or false values with logical operators.

Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables:

Operator    Name	        Description	                                                 Example	
&& 	        Logical and	    Returns true if both statements are true	                 x < 5 &&  x < 10	
||      	Logical or	    Returns true if one of the statements is true	             x < 5 || x < 4	
!	        Logical not	    Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true	     !(x < 5 && x < 10)
